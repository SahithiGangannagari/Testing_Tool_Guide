# Setting Up Python Environment and Running the App

This guide will help you set up a Python environment in your local system, install project requirements from a `requirements.txt` file, and run the Python app using the `app.py` file.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- pip (Python package manager)

## Step 1: Clone the Project Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project repository:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/preferred/directory

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
## Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
## Step 4: Install Project Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Step 5: Run the App
Now that you have set up the environment and installed the requirements, you can run the Python app using the app.py file. Use the following command:
python app.py
