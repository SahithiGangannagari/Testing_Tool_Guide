# Setting Up Python Environment and Running the App

This guide will help you set up a Python environment in your local system, install project requirements from a `requirements.txt` file, and run the Python app using the `app.py` file.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- pip (Python package manager)

## Step 1: Clone the Project Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project repository:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/preferred/directory

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
## Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
## Step 4: Install Project Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Step 5: Run the App
Now that you have set up the environment and installed the requirements, you can run the Python app using the app.py file. Use the following command:
python app.py

# Importing MySQL Database with XAMPP

1. Start XAMPP and ensure MySQL is running.

2. Open phpMyAdmin in your browser: [http://localhost/phpmyadmin/](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/).

3. Create a new database (optional).

4. Click on the database you want to import data into.

5. Go to the "Import" tab.

6. Click "Choose File" and select `testing.sql`.

7. Click "Go".

8. Once the import is complete, you'll see a success message.

9. Update your application to use the local database.

You're done! The `testing.sql` file is now imported into your local MySQL database.
